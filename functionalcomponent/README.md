There are two types of component:

Function Component.
Class Component.
 

1. Function Component

In react js one can just create a js function to create a component.
React recomends functional component type over class based component.
Fucntional components returns a React element.
One can write there HTML or JSX code inside return statement to render the UI.
Functional components by default does not come with state management features.
We need to use Hooks to make functional components stateful.
